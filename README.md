# simple-drupal-crud

After enabling the module, you can navigate to the /admin/structure/my_entity page and create, edit, and delete instances of the MyEntity entity.

To add a list of entities to a view (such as a block or page), go to the /admin/structure/views/add page and create a new view. In the "Show" section, select the "MyEntity" entity. Next, you can add fields, sorts, filters, etc. as in the normal presentation.
